# TFE4141 Design of Digital Systems - Term Project

This repository contains the term project for the course _TFE4141 â€“ Design of Digital Systems_ at NTNU, completed by Group 16 in Fall 2025.

The task is to write a fast implementation of the RSA algorithm, which involves solving the equation $C = M^e \bmod n$, where $C$ is the ciphertext, $M$ is the original message and $e$ and $n$ form the public key used for encryption.
